# Face Recognition System using AlexNet
This repository contains the implementation of a face recognition system developed as part of a university course on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Leveraging AlexNet, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, the system identifies and classifies faces with high accuracy.

# Features:
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes AlexNet for feature extraction and classification.

Dataset Handling: Preprocessed dataset for face images.

Training and Testing: Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics included.

Customizable Codebase: Easily adaptable for different datasets and applications.

# Applications:
Personal identification systems.

Security and surveillance systems.

Human-computer interaction.
